        Erode Venkatappa Ramasamy (17 September 1879 - 24 December 1973), commonly known as Periyar, was an Indian social activist and politician. He was the organizer of the Self-Respect Movement and 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravidar_Kazhagam">Dravidar Kazhagam</a> and is considered the architect of Dravidian politics.
        Periyar joined the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress">Indian National Congress</a> in 1919 and participated in the Vaikom Satyagraha, during which he was imprisoned twice. He resigned from the Congress in 1925, believing that they only served the interests of Brahmins. From 1929 to 1932, he toured British Malaya, Europe and the Soviet Union which later influenced his Self-Respect Movement in favor of caste equality. In 1939, he became the head of the Justice Party, which he transformed into a social organisation named Dravidar Kazhagam in 1944
        The party later split with one group led by<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._N._Annadurai">C. N. Annadurai</a> forming the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam">Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam</a> (DMK) in 1949. While continuing the Self-Respect Movement, he advocated for an independent Dravida Nadu (land of the Dravidians).
        <br>
        <br>Periyar promoted the principles of rationalism, self-respect, women's rights and eradication of caste. He opposed the exploitation and marginalisation of the non-Brahmin Dravidian people of South India and the imposition of what he considered Indo-Aryan India. Since 2021, the Indian state of Tamil Nadu celebrates his birth anniversary as 'Social Justice Day'. His supporters hail him as a champion of social equality whereas critics denounce him for being a separatist.

        <br><h1><u>Biography</u></h1>
        <br>
        <h2>Early years</h2>
        Erode Venkata Ramasamy was born on 17 September 1879 to a Kannada speaking Balija merchant family in
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erode">Erode</a>, then a part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coimbatore_district">Coimbatore district</a> of the Madras Presidency. Ramasamy's father was Venkatappa Nayakar (or Venkata), and his mother was Chinnathyee Muthammal. He had one elder brother named Krishnaswamy and two sisters named Kannamma and Ponnuthoy. He later came to be known as "Periyar", meaning 'respected one' or 'elder' in Tamil
        <br>
        <br>Periyar married when he was 19, and had a daughter who lived for only 5 months. His first wife <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._V._R._Nagammai">Nagammai</a>, died in 1933. Periyar married for a second time in July 1948. 
        His second wife <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._V._R._Maniammai">Maniammai</a>, continued Periyar's social work after his death in 1973, and his ideas then were advocated by Dravidar Kazhagam
    </p>
    <h2>Member of Congress (1919-1925)</h2>
    <p>
        Periyar joined the Indian National Congress in 1919 after quitting his business and resigning from public posts. He held the chairmanship of Erode Municipality and wholeheartedly undertook constructive programs spreading the use of Khadi, picketing 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toddy_shop">toddy shops</a>, boycotting shops selling foreign cloth, and eradicating untouchability.
        In 1921, Periyar courted imprisonment for picketing toddy shops in Erode. When his wife as well as his sister joined the agitation, it gained momentum, and the administration was forced to come to a compromise. He was again arrested during the Non-Cooperation movement and the Temperance movement. In 1922, Periyar was elected the President of the Madras Presidency Congress Committee during the Tirupur session, where he advocated strongly for reservation in government jobs and education. His attempts were defeated in the Congress party due to discrimination and indifference, which led to his leaving the party in 1925.

    <h2>Dravidar Kazhagam (1944-onwards)</h2>
    <strong>Formation of the <i>Dravidar Kazhagam</i></strong>
    <p>At a rally in 1944, Periyar, in his capacity as the leader of the Justice Party, declared that the party would henceforth be known as the Dravidar Kazhagam, or "Dravidian Association". However, a few who disagreed with Periyar started a splinter group, claiming to be the original Justice Party. This party was led by veteran Justice Party leader<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._T._Rajan">P. T. Rajan</a>  and survived until 1957.
    <br>
    <br>The Dravidar Kazhagam came to be well known among the urban communities and students. Villages were influenced by its message. Hindi, and ceremonies that had become associated with Brahmanical priesthood, were identified as alien symbols that should be eliminated from Tamil culture. Brahmins, who were regarded as the guardians of such symbols, came under verbal attack. From 1949 onwards, the Dravidar Kazhagam intensified social reformist work and put forward the fact that superstitions were the cause for the degeneration of Dravidians. The Dravidar Kazhagam vehemently fought for the abolition of untouchability amongst the Dalits. It also focused its attention on the liberation of women, women's education, willing marriage, widow marriage, orphanages and mercy homes
    </p>
    <h2>Split with Annadurai</h2>
    <p>In 1949, Periyar's chief lieutenant, Conjeevaram Natarajan Annadurai, established a separate association called the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), or Dravidian Progressive Federation
        This was due to differences between the two, while Periyar advocated a separate independent Dravidian or Tamil state, Annadurai compromised with the Delhi government, at the same time claiming increased state independence.
        Periyar was convinced that individuals and movements that undertake the task of eradicating the social evils in the Indian sub-continent have to pursue the goal with devotion and dedication without deviating from the path and with uncompromising zeal. Thus, if they contest elections aiming to assume political power, they would lose vigour and a sense of purpose. But among his followers, there were those who had a different view, wanting to enter into politics and have a share in running the government. Thus, when Periyar married Maniammai on 9 July 1948, they quit the Dravidar Kazhagam, stating that Periyar married Maniammayar who was the daughter of Kanagasabhai when he was 70 and she 32. Those who parted company with Periyar joined the DMK. Though the DMK split from the Dravidar Kazhagam, the organisation made efforts to carry on Periyar's Self-Respect Movement to villagers and urban students. The DMK advocated the thesis that the Tamil language was much richer than Sanskrit and Hindi in content, and thus was a key which opened the door to subjects to be learned.
        The Dravidar Kazhagam continued to counter Brahminism, Indo-Aryan propaganda, and uphold the Dravidians' right of self-determination.
