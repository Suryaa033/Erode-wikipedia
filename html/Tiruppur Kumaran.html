        Tiruppur Kumaran also known as Kodi Kaatha Kumaran (4 October 1904 - 11 January 1932) was an Indian revolutionary and freedom fighter who participated in the Indian independence movement. He held on to the Indian tricolor flag even during his death.

        Kumaran was born as Kumaraswamy Mudaliyar. His parents were Nachimuthu Mudaliyar and Karuppaayi Amma. He founded the Desa Bandhu Youth Association and led protests against the British. He died from injuries sustained from a police assault on the banks of Noyyal River in Tiruppur during a protest march against the British government on 11 January 1932. At the time of his death, he was holding the flag of the Indian nationalists, which had been banned by the British giving rise to the epithet kodi Kaatha Kumaran in Tamil which means "Kumaran who protected the flag".
